On this screen, enter the following details:

- **Pipedrive API Key** - this is the token you created in the previous steps
- **Domain Prefix** - this is your company name found in your Pipedrive URL, e.g. this will be `mycompany` if your Pipedrive URL is `https://mycompany.pipedrive.com`

To configure who can see and use the Pipedrive app, head to the "Permissions" tab and select those users and/or groups you'd like to have access.

When you're happy, click "Install".
